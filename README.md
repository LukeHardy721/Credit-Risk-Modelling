# Credit Risk Modelling with LendingClub Data

This project aims to build a machine learning model to assess credit risk using publicly available LendingClub loan data. The goal is to predict whether a loan will default, helping lenders make better risk-based decisions.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: [LendingClub Loan Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club/data)
- **Size**: 2,260,701 x 151
- **Data Type**: Historical loan data (e.g., loan amount, term, interest rate, grade, employment, etc.)
- **Target Variable**: `loan_status` â€” used to define whether a loan is "good" or "bad"

---

## ðŸ’¡ Objective

To develop a **binary classification model** that predicts whether a loan will default based on borrower and loan characteristics.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ðŸ§ª Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Basic data cleaning
   - Drop irrelevant or leakage features
2. **EDA & Preprocessing**
   - Explore features
   - Analye relationships with the target
   - Create new features (e.g., `debt_to_income`)
   - Impute missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
3. **Modelling**
   - Linear Regression
      - Analyse collinearity
      - PCA
      - SMOTE
      - Stochastic Gradient Descent
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
   - Evaluate with ROC AUC, F1 score and PR AUC

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

| Model              | ROC AUC Score | F1 Score | PR AUC |
|--------------------|---------------|----------|--------|
| LogisticRegression | 0.71          | 0.70     | 0.38   |
| RandomForest       | 0.72          | 0.72     | 0.39   |
| XGBoost            | 0.74          | 0.70     | 0.42   |

*(Results will vary depending on hyperparameters and train/test split)*

Our model shows that, given the assumption of a 10% recovery rate for defaulted loans, we could cut ~22% of the riskiest loans and that would result in an optimal net gain of $557m. This does not account for more complex assumptions such as the time value of money, the opportunity cost of approving a loan, etc.
